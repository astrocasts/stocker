## Astrocasts â€“ Diving into Prooph

Stocker is a demo project built as a part of [Diving into Prooph](https://astrocasts.com/live-sessions/projects/diving-into-prooph), an [Astrocasts](https://astrocasts.com/) live session exploring Event Sourcing and CQRS using [Prooph](http://getprooph.org/).

Prooph provides enterprise-ready CQRS and Event Sourcing packages for PHP. In this series, we'll take a look at building an application from scratch using various Prooph components including [Prooph Event Store v8](https://github.com/prooph/event-store).

We'll look at setting up and managing [Event Store](https://eventstore.org/), integrating with [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) and maybe some Kubernetes setup for good measure.

In typical Astrocasts Live Sessions fashion, I won't have any practical experience with Prooph Event Store v8 beyond what you'll see in each session. For that matter, I haven't properly worked with Event Store or Kubernetes, either.

It... should be fun.
